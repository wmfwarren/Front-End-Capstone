# Dicehammer
### A Warhammer 40K Statistics Engine
#### By: Marshall Friskics-Warren

This app is designed to allow Warhammer 40k players to make informed choices about weapons and units in different situations. The calculator is designed to take into account types of in game events that other “MathHammer” calculators do not have the ability to deal with. An example of this is rerolling only rolls of 1 on a six-sided die. Most calculators that account for rerolls only account for total rerolls.  

The app is designed to be straightforward and easy to use by walking players through the  calculation process and giving them meaningful results along the way.
